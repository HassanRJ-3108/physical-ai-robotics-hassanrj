# Conclusion

Setting up the right hardware is a critical first step in any robotics project. By choosing the right workstation, leveraging the power of edge computing, selecting the appropriate sensors and actuators, and outfitting your lab with the necessary infrastructure, you will be well on your way to building the next generation of intelligent robots.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout this chapter, we've covered the essential hardware components for robotics:

✅ **Powerful Workstation**: Linux-based development machine with strong CPU, GPU, and RAM

✅ **Edge Computing**: NVIDIA Jetson for onboard AI and real-time processing

✅ **Sensors**: Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and other sensors for perception

✅ **Actuators**: Motors, servos, and controllers for movement and manipulation

✅ **Lab Infrastructure**: Tools, workspace, safety equipment, and prototyping capabilities

## Building Your Lab

### Start Small

You don't need everything at once:

1. **Begin with basics**: Workstation, basic tools, simple sensors
2. **Add as needed**: Expand based on project requirements
3. **Learn and iterate**: Understand each component before adding more
4. **Budget wisely**: Invest in quality for frequently used items

### Recommended Progression

**Phase 1: Foundation** ($1500-2500)
- Development workstation
- Basic hand tools
- Soldering equipment
- Simple sensors (camera, IMU)
- Small motors and servos

**Phase 2: Expansion** (+$1000-2000)
- 3D printer
- Jetson Nano or Xavier NX
- More sensors (LiDAR, depth camera)
- Better actuators
- Improved workspace

**Phase 3: Advanced** (+$2000-5000)
- High-end Jetson (AGX Orin)
- Professional sensors
