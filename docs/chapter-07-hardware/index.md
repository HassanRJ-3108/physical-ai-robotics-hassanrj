# Building Your Robotics Lab

A successful robotics project starts with a solid hardware foundation. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a hobbyist, having the right hardware and a well-equipped workspace is essential for bringing your robotic creations to life.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive guide to setting up your robotics lab, from choosing a workstation and understanding the role of edge computing, to selecting the right sensors and actuators, and outfitting your lab with the necessary infrastructure and tools.

## Essential Components

A complete robotics lab requires:

### 1. Development Workstation
A powerful computer for:
- Writing and compiling code
- Running simulations
- Training AI models
- Analyzing data
- Visualizing robot behavior

### 2. Edge Computing Platform
Onboard computer for the robot:
- Real-time control
- Sensor processing
- AI inference
- Autonomous operation

### 3. Sensors
The robot's senses:
- Cameras for vision
- LiDAR for 3D mapping
- IMUs for orientation
- Force sensors for touch
- Microphones for audio

### 4. Actuators
The robot's muscles:
- Motors for movement
- Grippers for manipulation
- Servos for precise control

### 5. Lab Infrastructure
Supporting equipment:
- Workbenches and tools
- Power supplies
- Testing equipment
- Safety gear
- Prototyping tools

## Planning Your Lab

Before purchasing equipment, consider:

**Budget**: Determine your available resources

**Space**: How much room do you have?

**Goals**: What types of robots will you build?

**Scalability**: Plan for future expansion

**Safety**: Ensure adequate safety measures

This chapter will guide you through each component to help you build an effective robotics lab.
