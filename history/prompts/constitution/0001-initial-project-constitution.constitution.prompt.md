command: /sp.constitution Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Learning Platform

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. CODE QUALITY
   - Use Docusaurus 3.x for documentation structure
   - Markdown-first architecture for all content
   - TypeScript strict mode for all code
   - Component-based design with React best practices
   - Zero external dependencies where possible

2. USER EXPERIENCE
   - Beautiful, modern design inspired by premium tech documentation
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Fast page loads and smooth navigation
   - Clear visual hierarchy for content structure
   - Dark/light mode built-in

3. CONTENT ORGANIZATION
   - Physical AI fundamentals as foundational module
   - Robotics engineering topics as main curriculum
   - Humanoid robotics as advanced applications
   - Modular chapter structure for easy updates
   - Clear learning path from basics to advanced

4. DESIGN STANDARDS
   - Consistent color palette (3-5 colors max)
   - Typography: 2 font families maximum
   - Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
   - Flexbox for layout

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution to version 1.0.0, establishing core principles for CODE QUALITY, USER EXPERIENCE, CONTENT ORGANIZATION, and DESIGN STANDARDS. Identified several dependent templates and documentation files that require manual review and potential updates to align with the new constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initialized project constitution with core principles.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Manual follow-up needed for templates and README.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the constitution and identified downstream impacts.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
