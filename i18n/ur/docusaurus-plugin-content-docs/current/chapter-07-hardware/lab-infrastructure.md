# Lab Infrastructure

In addition to the robot itself, you will need a well-equipped lab space to support your robotics development. A good lab setup improves productivity, safety, and the quality of your work.

## Workspace

### Work Surface

**Workbench or Large Table**:
- Minimum 4ft x 2ft (1.2m x 0.6m)
- Sturdy construction
- Adjustable height is a plus
- Non-conductive surface for electronics

**Organization**:
- Tool organizers and pegboards
- Parts bins and storage drawers
- Cable management
- Adequate lighting

### Testing Area

**Robot Testing Space**:
- Clear floor area for robot movement
- Flat, level surface
- Adequate clearance around obstacles
- Safety barriers if needed

**Considerations**:
- Size depends on robot dimensions
- Indoor vs. outdoor testing
- Lighting for cameras
- Power access

## Power

### Electrical Requirements

**Outlets**:
- Multiple power outlets (minimum 6-8)
- Surge protectors
- Separate circuits for high-power equipment
- Grounded outlets

**Power Supplies**:
- Bench power supply (variable voltage/current)
- Battery chargers
- USB power adapters
- Voltage regulators

**Safety**:
- Circuit breakers
- GFCI outlets near water
- Fire extinguisher nearby
- Emergency shut-off accessible

## Tools

### Hand Tools

**Essential**:
- Screwdriver set (Phillips, flathead, Torx)
- Allen key/hex key set
- Pliers (needle-nose, regular, cutting)
- Wire strippers
- Tweezers
- Utility knife
- Measuring tape
- Calipers (digital recommended)

**Nice to Have**:
- Crimping tool
- Heat gun
- Dremel rotary tool
- Files and sandpaper
- Vise or clamp

### Electronics Tools

**Essential**:
- Soldering iron (temperature-controlled)
- Solder and flux
- Desoldering pump or wick
- Multimeter (voltage, current, resistance)
- Breadboards
- Jumper wires
- Heat shrink tubing

**Advanced**:
- Oscilloscope
- Logic analyzer
- Function generator
- Hot air rework station
- PCB holder/helping hands

### Software Tools

**Development**:
- IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, CLion)
- Version control (Git)
- Terminal emulator
- SSH client

**Robotics**:
- ROS 2 installation
- Simulation tools (Gazebo, RViz)
- CAD software (Fusion 360, FreeCAD)
- 3D printing slicer (Cura, PrusaSlicer)

## Prototyping Equipment

### 3D Printer

A 3D printer is invaluable for creating custom parts.

**Recommended Features**:
- Build volume: 200x200x200mm minimum
- Heated bed
- Auto bed leveling
- Reliable brand (Prusa, Creality, Bambu Lab)

**Materials**:
- PLA (easy, good for prototypes)
- PETG (stronger, more durable)
- TPU (flexible)
- ABS (strong, requires enclosure)

**Cost**: $200-$1000

### Other Prototyping Tools

**Laser Cutter**: For precise 2D parts (acrylic, wood)

**CNC Mill**: For metal and precise parts (advanced)

**Electronics Prototyping**:
- PCB design software (KiCad, Eagle)
- PCB fabrication service (JLCPCB, PCBWay)

## Safety Equipment

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

**Essential**:
- Safety glasses (always wear when working)
- Anti-static wrist strap (for electronics)
- Work gloves (for handling sharp parts)

**Recommended**:
- Hearing protection (for loud tools)
- Dust mask (for 3D printing, soldering)
- First aid kit

### Lab Safety

**Fire Safety**:
- Fire extinguisher (ABC type)
- Smoke detector
- Fireproof container for batteries
- No flammable materials near heat sources

**Electrical Safety**:
- Proper grounding
- No overloaded circuits
- Keep liquids away from electronics
- Emergency shut-off accessible

**Chemical Safety**:
- Proper ventilation for soldering
- Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)
- Proper disposal of chemicals
- Eye wash station (if using chemicals)

## Storage and Organization

**Component Storage**:
- Labeled bins for parts
- Anti-static bags for electronics
- Organized by category
- Inventory system

**Tool Storage**:
- Toolbox or tool chest
- Pegboard for frequently used tools
- Drawer organizers
- Everything has a place

**Cable Management**:
- Cable ties and velcro straps
- Cable organizers
- Labeled cables
- Separate power and signal cables

## Environmental Considerations

**Temperature and Humidity**:
- Comfortable working temperature (20-25°C)
- Moderate humidity (30-50%)
- Climate control if needed

**Lighting**:
- Bright overhead lighting
- Task lighting for detailed work
- Natural light if possible
- Adjustable desk lamp

**Ventilation**:
- Good air circulation
- Fume extraction for soldering
- Open windows or exhaust fan

## Budget Considerations

### Minimal Setup ($500-1000)
- Basic hand tools
- Soldering iron and multimeter
- Small workbench
- Essential safety equipment

### Standard Setup ($2000-5000)
- Complete tool set
- 3D printer
- Bench power supply
- Oscilloscope
- Proper workbench and storage

### Professional Setup ($10,000+)
- High-end tools
- Multiple 3D printers
- Laser cutter
- Full electronics lab
- Dedicated testing area

Start with the essentials and expand your lab as your needs and budget grow. A well-organized, safe, and properly equipped lab will make your robotics work more enjoyable and productive.
